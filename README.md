# Human Activity Recognition

<p align="justify">Mobile devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest generation of
smart cell phones now incorporates many diverse and powerful sensors. These
sensors include GPS sensors, vision sensors (i.e., cameras), audio sensors (i.e.,
microphones), light sensors, temperature sensors, direction sensors (i.e., magnetic
compasses), and acceleration sensors (i.e., accelerometers). The availability of
these sensors in mass-marketed communication devices creates exciting new
opportunities for data mining and data mining applications. The availability of
diverse and powerful sensors in smart cell phones is highly valuable for Human
Activity Recognition (HAR) by enabling the acquisition of useful information.

<p align="justify">Did you ever wonder what your smartphone knows about you? Or how it learns about
you? Wouldn't it be great if it could tell you things that you don't even recognize about
how you walk, talk and act? Smartphones are already capable of doing this, and
many researchers are dedicated to finding ways to gather and interpret the most
useful information.</p>
  
<p align="justify">In this Project, we have studied an open-source dataset. In our study, we have
conducted data exploration, activity exploration, participant exploration, and
personal information exploration analysis to collect valuable insights into human
activity recognition.</p>
